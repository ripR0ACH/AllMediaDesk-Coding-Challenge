## Notes from me

    Downloaded challenge @: 2:40am
    Started challenge @: 3:00am
    Finished challenge @: 6:18am

    In order to run this code, you should be running
    on Python3. The only thing needed is a command
    line, and on part 3 you will need to
    
        pip install matplotlib
    
    to see the graphs.

    Part 1 contains the solved basic calculator 
    portion of the challenge. In order to test it, 
    you can just run the code in the command line 
    and give it an expression to solve. 

    Part 2 contains the solution for Peter's 
    numbers, and is to be run on the command line 
    too.

    Part 3 is basically the exact same code as for 
    part 1, however it will take into account a 
    "y =" and x variables to create a matplotlib 
    graph representing the equation.

    Thanks so much for this opportunity,
